# Notes

These contracts are extracted directly from newest Scheduled Callbacks implementation to simplify cadence linting when using FlowCallbackScheduler because they are only deployed on the emulator and cannot be installed with flow deps install command.

The contracts are taken at the same commit used in the version of the flow emulator imported in the latest flow-cli project version. 

They don't need to be deployed because they are already in the emulator.
